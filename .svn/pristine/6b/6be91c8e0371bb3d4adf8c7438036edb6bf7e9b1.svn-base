What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I wrote some unit testing for curl
	- I came up with necessary test cases for testing ls
	- I did further bugtesting for ls and curl
	- I modified ls and curl to incorporate pError from StandardOutput
	- I modified ls to incorporate iterator design pattern and fixed all emerging bugs

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - I plan to write JUnit test for ls, mv, exit, and cd
    - I plan to update comments in ls
    - I plan to shorten the methods in ls so that they are within 30 lines

Am I blocked on anything?
    - No
