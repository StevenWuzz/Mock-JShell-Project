What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished error class 
    - Worked on Concatenate
    - Fixed up history
    - Added comments for some classes
    

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finish Concatenate
    - Finish Popd and Pushd once Pwd and Cd are finished
    - Implement traversal for Concatenate
    - Make documentation for commands I've worked on
    - Work on Error if any changes need to be made

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need Pwd and Cd for Popd and Pushd
    - Also need Pwd and Cd for concatenate traversal
