What did I work on in the last three days?
	- Changed Mkdir capacity to allow for any number of arguments
	- Updated Mkdir Man page
    - Finished CRC Cards for Tree, Move, and Remove
    - Started and finished implementation of Tree and Man page for Tree
    - Finished Man pages for Move and Remove
    - Finished recursive deletion algorithm for Remove

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Add implementation to check if Remove path interferes with current directory path
    - Use Copy and Remove to implement Move

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Waiting for Copy to be finished so it can be used in Move
    - Need to finish Remove to use it in Move
