What did I work on in the last three days?
	- I modified Ls class to enable recursive mode
	- I redesigned Ls class since recursive slightly changed the overall structure
	- I completed all the comments and javadocs for Ls
	- I completely implemented all the methods in Curl
	- I completed all the ccomments and javadocs for Curl

What do I plan to work in the next three days?

    - Write JUnit test for exit
    - Write JUnit test for cd
    - Write JUnit test for ls
    - Write JUnit test for mv
