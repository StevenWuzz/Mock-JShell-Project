What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished first pass on the List.java class
    - Tried out several designs and approach for methods inside List.java class
    - Discussed with my co-workers on how to modify the (design) implementations for sprint2

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Modify the List.java class further (working more on the design and efficiency)
    - Implement functionality to display concatenated files to the shell
    - Implement a class for change directory functionality 

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I need an implementation of a class to save all the files (fileTree)
